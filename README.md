Based on the pulled data, there appears to be less correlation between cloudiness, humidity, or windspeed and the latitude or "closeness to the equator". 
However, based on regression data analysis there is a correlation between the cloudiness and humidity and to a lesser extent windspeed and latitude.
Based on the pulled data, there appears to be a disproportionate drop in temperature the higher latitudes than the comparable negative latitudes. This demonstrates a shift outside of just latitudes determining the temperature.
